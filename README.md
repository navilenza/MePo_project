# MePo_project
The node publisher isn't handled properly : 
The robot doesn't actually rotate but :
             Current angle: {math.degrees(current_angle)}, 
             Target angle: {math.degrees(relative_angle)}"
             are updated

The node isn't destroyed after moving forward is done do the value published of the distance is inacurate
